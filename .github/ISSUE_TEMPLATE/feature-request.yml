      **Thank you for wanting to suggest a feature for setuptools!**


      üí°
      Before you go ahead with your request, please first consider if it
      would be useful for majority of the setuptools users. As a general
      rule of thumb, any feature that is only of interest to a small sub
      group should be implemented in a third-party plugin or maybe even
      just your project alone. Be mindful of the fact that the core
      setuptools features have a broad impact.
