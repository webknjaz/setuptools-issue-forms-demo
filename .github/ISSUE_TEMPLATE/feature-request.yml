      **Thank you for wanting to suggest a feature for setuptools!**


      üí°
      Before you go ahead with your request, please first consider if it wouldn't be
      better suited for a plugin. As a general rule of thumb, any feature that is only
      of interest to a small sub group should be moved into a plugin. Only such features
      that are of interest to a majority of OctoPrint's users will be implemented as
      part of the core itself.
