      **Thank you for wanting to report a bug in setuptools!**



      ⚠
      Verify first that your issue is not
      [already reported on GitHub][issue search] and keep in mind and keep in
      mind that we may have to keep the current behavior because [every change
      breaks someone's workflow][XKCD 1172] and we try to be mindful about it.
      Also test if the latest release and main branch are affected too.

      If you are seeking community support, please consider
